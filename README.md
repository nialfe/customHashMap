#custom Hash Map

After a few enlightening hash map interview experiences
I have decided to try to implement one on my own.

All work done in C++

###Some invariants for the class 
#####(subject to change and/or expand)
1. Input size into constructor for use as hashing function
2. 2 functions: put and get
3. Check headers for others invariants (coming soon!)

Will probably end up separating this project in iterations using folders.  
The main focus will be improving the hash functions, complexities, etc
