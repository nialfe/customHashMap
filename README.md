#custom Hash Map

After a few enlightening hash map interview experiences
I have decided to try to implement one on my own.

All work done in C++

###Some invariants for the class 
#####(subject to change and/or expand)
1. Input size into constructor for use as hashing function
2. 2 functions: put and get
3. Check headers for others invariants (coming soon!)
